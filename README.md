## Development Process
1. Ensure to understand the challenge and wireframe creation
Desktop
![alt text](https://placem.at/places?h=300 =250x "Desktop Wireframe")
Mobile
![alt text](https://placem.at/places?h=300 =250x  "Mobile Wireframe")

2. Review data source (JSON) and analyze how to integrate
3. Decided to use Angular's $http service to load the JSON
4. Worked on the logic of how to toggle the contact details
5. and CSS animation
6. Finally the fun part: Theme and styling, used LESS to leverage variables and DRY the stylesheet.
